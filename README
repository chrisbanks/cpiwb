For DICE Scientific Linux, execute "./build" to build, "cabal run" to run, and
"cabal build" to build again.

For systems like Debian Jessie with more recent gcc and cabal versions, it's
necessary to point back to earlier generations.  

  ./build --with-gcc=gcc-4.8 --cabal-lib-version=1.18.1.15

Here the gcc version needs to be less than 5, and cabal less than 1.22.
