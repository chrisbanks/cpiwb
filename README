This version is packaged for building with Cabal.  It uses sandboxes, which
requries a version of Cabal at least 1.18; and for other reasons the version
has to be less than 1.22.  

The current DICE, running Scientific Linux 7, satisfies this. 

Execute "./build" to build, "cabal run" to run, and "cabal build" to build
again.

For systems like Debian Jessie with more recent gcc and Cabal versions, it's
necessary to point back to earlier generations.  

  ./build --with-gcc=gcc-4.8 --cabal-lib-version=1.18.1.15

Here the gcc version needs to be less than 5, and Cabal less than 1.22.
